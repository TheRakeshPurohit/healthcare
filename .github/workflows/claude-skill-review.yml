          prompt: |
            Review the plugin changes in PR ${{ github.repository }}/pull/${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}.

            First, identify what type of changes are being made:
            - **Skills**: Changes to SKILL.md files or *-skill/ directories
            - **MCP Servers**: Changes to plugin.json with mcpServers configuration
            - **Marketplace Config**: Changes to marketplace.json

            Then apply the appropriate review criteria:

            ---

            ## For Skills (SKILL.md changes)

            Use the skill-creator guidelines to review:

            **1. Frontmatter Quality**
            - Does SKILL.md have proper YAML frontmatter with `name` and `description` fields?
            - Is the `description` comprehensive enough to trigger the skill appropriately?
            - Does description include both what the skill does AND when to use it?

            **2. Conciseness (Context Window is a Public Good)**
            - Is the SKILL.md under 500 lines?
            - Does it only include information Claude doesn't already know?
            - Are examples used instead of verbose explanations where appropriate?

            **3. Progressive Disclosure**
            - Is content split appropriately between SKILL.md and references/?
            - Are reference files properly linked and described in SKILL.md?
            - Is detailed/variant-specific content moved to reference files?

            **4. Degrees of Freedom**
            - Is specificity matched to task fragility?
            - Are scripts used for fragile/deterministic operations?
            - Is appropriate flexibility given for context-dependent decisions?

            **5. Resource Organization**
            - Are scripts/ for executable code that needs deterministic reliability?
            - Are references/ for documentation loaded as-needed?
            - Are assets/ for output resources (templates, images)?
            - No extraneous files (README.md, CHANGELOG.md, etc.)?

            **6. Quality Standards**
            - Uses imperative/infinitive form in instructions?
            - No deeply nested references (keep one level deep)?
            - Large reference files (>100 lines) have table of contents?

            ---

            ## For MCP Servers (plugin.json with mcpServers)

            **1. Plugin Metadata**
            - Has required fields: name, version, description, author
            - Description clearly explains what the MCP server provides
            - Version follows semver format

            **2. MCP Server Configuration**
            - mcpServers object has descriptive key names
            - Server type is appropriate (http, stdio, etc.)
            - URL is valid and uses HTTPS for http type

            **3. Documentation**
            - Is there a README or similar explaining how to use the MCP?
            - Are any required API keys or authentication documented?

            ---

            ## For Marketplace Config (marketplace.json)

            **1. Plugin Entry**
            - New plugins have: name, source, description, category, tags
            - Description is clear and concise
            - Tags are relevant and consistent with existing patterns
            - Source path is correct

            **2. Consistency**
            - Follows existing patterns in the marketplace
            - Category matches the marketplace theme

            ---
